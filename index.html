  <p> My skills and
  development seemed to lead me to computers. I played games for many years when I got inspired to try out game modification. Starting off
in LUA I helped out in customer support for <a href="www.crident.com">Crident</a> and <a href="www.forums.gmodserverguard.com">Serverguard</a>
a garrys mod administration plugin. In 2014 I started "FreeFall" a gaming network. Which shut at the end of 2017. Since then I've worked
on a project called <a href="https://blacklabelhost.com/">Black Label Host</a> As the project manager.</p>
